    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Thai style omelet (kai jeow) is so easy to make that you can cook it as a last-minute meal or a late night snack. Kai jeow is a pan-fried omelet that is infused with a combination of complex flavors. Kai jeow's sweet, sour, spicy, salty and umami flavor combination is the epitome of Southeast Asian cuisine. When you take your first bite, it will transport you to the streets of Bangkok. </p>
    <h3>Ingredient</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Fish sauces</li>
            <li>Optional: Some minced meat for example Shrimp,chicken, and pork</li>
            <li>Dice onion and tomato</li>
            <li>Chopped Thai chilies and minced garlic</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Take one green onion and remove the root. Then, finely chop the rest and set aside.            </li>
            <li> Heat ¼ cup of vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat.            </li>
            <li>Crack an egg into a bowl. Add the chopped green onion, ½ teaspoon of fish sauce and beat together with a fork.</li>
            <li> Check if the oil is hot enough. It should be lightly smoking hot. You could test by dipping a chopstick into the egg mixture and then into the oil. If it sizzles, that means it's ready. You can then pour the egg mixture into the center of the pan and fry for about 1 minute or until golden. If you're not sure, use a spatula to lift one edge up to see.</li>
            <li>Once one side is golden and the egg mixture holds together, flip the egg with a spatula and fry the other side for another minute or until golden. Then, turn off the heat and serve.</li>
        </ol>
